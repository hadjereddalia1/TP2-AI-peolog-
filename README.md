+ Eddalia Hadjer

#### Exercise Instructions: 
1. Write a Prolog predicate that is true if x is an element of the list L.
2. `first(E, L)` is true if E is the first element of L.
3. Write a Prolog predicate `last` that finds the last element of a list L.
4. Write a Prolog predicate `penultimate` that finds the penultimate (second-to-last)
element of a list L.
5. Write a Prolog predicate that removes the Kth element from a list L1 and writes the
result into a list L2.
`?- del_k(X,[a,b,c,d],2,R).`
X = b
R = [a,c,d])
6. Define the predicate `length(L, N)`, which, given the list L, calculates its length N.
7. Define the predicate `even(L)` that is true if L has an even number of elements.
8. Define the predicate `concat(L1, L2, L3)` where L3 is the result of concatenating L1
and L2 (without using append).
9. Define the predicate `palindrome(L)` that is true if the list L is its own reversed image
(example: [x,a,m,a,x]).
